It is great for people who love painting also good for those who wanna learn painting. The community is also extremely good, so you can post your painting easily, you get likes and comments for good works. You can see others paintings and add it to your favorites if you want. And if you don't want to draw you can simply go for coloring."

Eventually I found the \"Buy Print\" feature. I didn't know what to expect, but I gave it a try. Very vibrant colors, so I expected to be disappointed, as a print wouldn't be back lit like it is on my phone. Pleasant surprise! So bright! Gorgeous print!

The interface has a bit of a learning curve, but is totally worth it, as it allows you to be very productive. They have a nice balance between the free version and the paid features - plenty of people will never need the paid features. If you use the product regularly, you'll want the pro features, and I think the price is a bargain compared to something like Adobe Illustrator.

        "I bought the full version of this app and all features years ago. Along with the Infinite Painter app. BOTH were awesome but unfortunately I have had multiple errors with Infinite design recently. Just in the last month I the app failed while trying to work on a project that is much smaller than others I have done with this app in the past. The first error locked me out and didn't recognize me as a paid user, which I have been for a handful of years. I had to re-install the app to get it to recognize my credentials. Perhaps my bad, but the uninstall process took with it my saved projects that weren't exported to SVG or PNG. Those were gone and unrecoverable. I started the project over again and near completion most of the layers I had cleared themselves and hours and hours of work was lost. I have reached out via their email because their forum won't let me create an account and they basically gave me a response that sounded like it was blaming me for their apps inability to function. It pains me to walk away from Infinite Design. It was the best Vector drawing app but 2 losses in a month and a loss at the end of last year has taught me I can not rely on this app for projects anymore. Apart from that some of the functions in the app have started to work differently or fail over the years. I wonder if there is enough upkeep. Using the lazy function or smooth function don't work as well as they used to. I was down to drawing my lines by hand in the app when I wanted them and exporting to SVG to clean up in a program on my PC. I hope this changes for the future."

        "The best app to listen to Marathi and English audio books at a very affordable price. This is the only provider that has wide variety of Marathi audio books that I was not able to find anywhere else. I was only interested in Marathi books and recently Storytel added a subscription option for Marathi only content at even less monthly subscription price. That's really awesome. App is also good, never hanged or created any issues. New audio player is better than last one and I am sure the team would be improving the player further. Short stories are excellent and there are frequent new releases. These are really good if you want to have a quick fun read/listen and lighten your mood or learn something new quickly. Statistics section is also good to understand your listening habits. 5 Stars for providing us with such a good variety of audio books and podcasts. Few things that can make the app better 1- Support for web based player so that we can also use it on PC. 2- Pause the audio when there is a notification on mobile. The app currently keeps audio playing in background if there is a notification. Most of audio apps pause the audio and after the notification sound, resumes the audio 3- Increase library content for latest English audio books (there are review or summaries available for latest books but feel that there is lack of latest English content compared to other providers). 4- Separate section for podcasts and books. Right now podcasts are mixed with books which for me is bit confusing. I start listening thinking that it is a book and then realize that its actually a podcast 5- Maybe have a modern color and look for the app. Current app works great, but looks a bit outdated. Also add support for light and dark modes 6- If possible, add option to buy books so that we can keep them forever and can listen to them anytime later even if the subscription expires. Also, search feature needs improvements. If I search for something, usually there are no results. Every time I have to depend on the curated lists or book tips section to find something that I would like to listen."

Search in-text for books only in a certain collection/series/by a certain author etc. would be really useful. 3. Sub-collections would be useful, collections in a main collection. 4.

Especially since the banners already at the bottom. I have been gone for awhile. Came back for some relaxation and the ads ridiculous. WAY TOO MANY ADS.

Visibility plot is a feature of the plus version, but it seems that if you purchase in-app-monthly google does not let you write a review for the plus version in the store, so I am trying to reach you here.

Some of it's many awesome features being: Perfect UI layout for easy navigation, Appropriately grouped workout routines, Wide variety of exercise library which you can use to create your own custom workout routines, & the best of all is the in-app videos demonstrating the accurate way to perform those exercises. Don't waste your time searching any other application cause this one right here is simply THE BEST.

It also helps me a lot with working out because it reminds me when to workout and it makes me stronger and very good. The lady in the workouts is very nice too because she always tells me when I\u2019m half way there and what the next exercise is. I used to never workout and always eat and yeah. But thanks to this app (and to quarantine) I was able to get back in shape! It is also very helpful because it allows me to adjust my rest time in between exercises. It just gets me in the shape. If you are not using this app and have to use other apps that aren\u2019t not free, idk WHAT you are doing! Very good app. Yeah, 10/10 would recommend it. Definitely. Very good."

You have really good back workouts spread across the other workouts - just bundle them (maybe add 1-2), done. 2. The \"Well done, congratulations!\" voice gets muffled in the end (I guess so the following ad can have full attention?) Please play the Well done sound loudly as it is such a rewarding experience. Then I am much more happy / attentive to watch/listen to the following ad. 3. Studies show that Waist-to-height ratio is more accurate than BMI when looking at obesity problems. Maybe you want to consider swapping or addting waist to hip. 4. It would be nice if (during the last seconds of the) current workout, the one coming up would be previewed so you can get mentally ready for the next one. Also when paused, the current workout should be visible. Keep it up - Thanks a lot for this great app! Til"

        "Excellent and very flexible app with a clean & well designed user interface which can also log your practice and provide statistics and has an accompanying wiki website with importable breathing patterns. Only improvements I would suggest would be the option to enable Google Fit or similar data sharing (categorising breathing as meditation would be good enough if there is no breathing category) as well an option to choose an expanding & contracting ball or sun animation during practice. In particular the app's dynamic mode was very useful for my Resonance Frequency Breathing practice as while this breathing pattern is quite simple in normal practice (with a fixed breathing rate, and according to some recent research as well as my own personal testing with equal length inhales & exhales as this actually maximises your Heart Rate Variability or HRV, not longer exhales contrary to a lot of suggestions) you do need to find your ideal breath rate (resonance frequency where your HRV is maximised) and possibly also re-assess it regularly according to some research (personally mine hasn't varied much between assessments). Personally I found that the best way to assess my resonance frequency was to shift through a range of frequencies without pausing or interrupting the practice and so I needed an app which could automatically vary the breath rate every 2 minutes. Using this app's Dynamic mode you can create such a multiple rate pre-set program quite easily."

        "Welp. Since the game keeps asking for my opinion, here it is. The game is really fun, you can get lost for a while playing this. But the replayability of the game is low. Some people enjoy fighting through the exact same level 40-50 times to get strong enough to get to the next level, but if you can't buy skips or don't have the time or patience for hours of gameplay everyday then this isn't for you. You aren't going to compete in the multiplayer. Give that dream up. Graphics are really good. The controls are pretty good, but they can get unresponsive at times. My suggestions for the developer(s) is to create more non-story content (not pvp). I enjoy the survival mode more than anything else, but if you look at the leaderboards....11+ hours are the best times in that mode. Come on. That needs fixing because 99.9999% of the human population doesn't have more than an hour or two at most to spend doing one particular thing (lest we have to remind people that most people have other things to do besides playing games). I'm fairly low level and I can run survival for 40 minutes. I won't be doing anything but skipping that from now on, skip availability pending; and so diminishes my favorite part of the game. I like what the devs have made here, but there are some serious issues that need to be addressed here for the sake of longevity of your game. I'm not writing a thesis paper here, so excuse me for not doting on the graphics (which truly are very nice) or other parts of the game I like. End note, the game is a lot of fun but will become monotonous fairly quickly. Enjoy while it lasts."

Each day you discover something new to explore and the ability to experiment with the characters are overwhelming but invigorating at the same time. Truly this is one of a kind experience that I wish everyone could just get a taste of. I only wish the best for the creators and developers in improving the game and I'll support them however I can. Once again, what an outstanding game!"

Loving it since Alto's adventure. I've completed all the goals. Upgraded all the powerups . After unlocking sumara (after 50 levels) the additional 10 levels were a pleasant surprise! Some sorta reward would have been nice after finishing 60 levels. Disappointed there a bit. Else, just loved the game every bit."

Especially for its Zen Mode which contains such a pleasant tunes which are like lullaby as well as in this mode, there's no limit of respawn (which is totally good) !!!

It's super fun, easy to play, and even the colour-based tasks(wires) are colourblind friendly! (I myself am ADHD/Autistic, so having the symbols on the wires is super helpful when I'm having trouble understanding the colours. Yes, this happens! To me, at least.)

Something to keep it more interesting like fuel powerups or temporary invincibility powerup or aliens. Or maybe moving platforms. Just something that makes it more challenging. Overall, it's a good game; the characters are fantastic; love the unique environments, backdrops and soundscapes that come with every character."

If you have a lot of space and get bored of DBL download Dokan and have some fun. There's a free LR waiting for you to use it."

        "Overall the game is good, but they force you to pay for it by ad at starting of a mission and when its done. I was able to finish most of the missions, after which it is not letting me go forward, no mission pops up after it, I try to attend the briefing and all it does is asks me to go away and not disturb the guy. I don't if its a trick by developer to force you to pay for the game or something else, but its annoying. Other issues: Game does not play in full screen, there are big black bars on both side which takes up half of the screen estate, and its not as involving due to this sole reason. In some missions you are forced to play with some outside help, meaning you will have 2 to 3 bot allies who will accompany you, and its a real pain in the ass. A mission which you will be able to finish off way faster and better, gets you killed due to those fools, you cant ask them to stop or halt and execute some silent kills. This feature should be added, where we can control the allies movement so it does not end up getting us killed. My advice to whoever struggling because of it will be just get them ambushed and take some cover, once they are killed don't revive them until the end of the mission."

        "Use to be fun! Until 2 days ago the game was great. 2 days ago the in game ads for extra cash, diamonds, and game boosters changed, but also locked up and no longer gives the rewards for watching them. Without the benefit of rewards, you not only waste time watching them cause you cannot back out of them not even home screen button works, but it makes progression in the game extremely slow. I deleted the game today because there is no way to get ahold of support to correct this situation. I am not going to be forced to waste my time with ads and no benefits as well as stuck at my level it takes all the fun out of the game. Parts of the game that should be removed or changed, in my opinion: 1) the stupid overpasses that block your view 2) the missiles launched at road block choke points, the impossible ones I seemed to always get that hit as I entered choke point. 3) the vehicles that constantly shoot rearward, they follow your every move. 4) the number of rear shooting vehicles in 1 screen 5) the fact that at about 1 minute mark, you can no longer destroy any vehicle other than hitting them and after hitting 5, you are dead. I am at max front and side guns and max armor. But am, according to the game, moving too fast for ammo to hit and destroy the targets. 6) constant road blocks. Remove about half of the road blocks and it would be more fun"

Plus, upgrades get really long after the first few levels so if that is combined with the difficulty to get more builders without paying money, it gets frustrating at times.

Though I love that they do that, I do wish things didnt take 3 weeks and max storage just for 1 upgrade(late game). Also the pathfinding n matchmaking have been top cons of this game since day 1. they say they've fixed it but its still just as bad unfortunately. I do really appreciate that you can play truly for free tho!",

A great idea would be to utilise the research building a bit more.

Then, once I get into the viewfinder, it gives me a distorted and stretched image, so, whatever object I point my camera to, the object appears completely stretched at an abnormal proportion... and finally, if I tap on the \"Clip\" button in order to take a picture, the only thing I would get is an error message. Worst of all, you are not allowed to use the app more than 10 times, after that, you will be asked to pay an overpriced subscription that just makes no sense at all considering the other alternatives with the same image quality even when those are either free, or with a one time purchase fee that is less than a 10th fraction of the yearly fee for this app.",

On several occasions, the app lowers quality of the clipped objects, stratches them unnaturally. It's a fine gimmick. But nothing else. The app is highly situational and cannot replace other tools with the same effectiveness for now. The price and 'free version' is absurd. It's too expensive. If it's more polished, more effective, and cheaper, I'd reconsider the rating.",

A heads-up on the fact that it can, and likely will, occasionally disconnect from your Fire Stick when you either navigate away from the app, if utilizing it on your phone, tablet, etc., or your when your screen goes black and locks. Great convenience and functionality.",
